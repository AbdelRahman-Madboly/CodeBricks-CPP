> **"Great software is built brick by brick."**

## 📖 Project Overview
**CodeBricks** is a structured engineering portfolio documenting the transition from **C++ Fundamentals** to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and finally to **Modern C++**.

This repository is not just code snippets; it is a roadmap designed to build the "Software Engineer Mindset" required for:
1.  **Embedded Systems** (Memory management, Bitwise operations)
2.  **Computer Vision & AI** (Data structures, Algorithmic efficiency)

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is divided into Learning Modules and Practical Problem Solving.

| Directory | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`01_Curriculum`** | Step-by-step lessons organized by topic (loops, functions, pointers). |
| **`02_Problem_Solving`** | Solutions to university-level engineering sheets and algorithmic challenges. |
| **`00_Roadmap`** | The strategic plan from Syntax to AI. |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** C++ (ISO Standard)
* **Environment:** VS Code (MinGW/GCC)
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🧩 Featured Problem Solving
Key algorithms implemented in this repository:
* [cite_start]**String Manipulation:** Custom implementation of string reversal and mirroring (Sheet 4)[cite: 215, 216].
* [cite_start]**Algorithmic Complexity:** Finding missing numbers in $O(n)$ time complexity (Sheet 5).
* [cite_start]**Bitwise Logic:** Low-level byte swapping and bit masking[cite: 244].

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeBricks-CPP.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeBricks-CPP.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to a specific lesson:
    ```bash
    cd 01_Curriculum/Part_03_Functions
    ```
3.  Compile and Run (using g++):
    ```bash
    g++ main.cpp -o app
    ./app
    ```
