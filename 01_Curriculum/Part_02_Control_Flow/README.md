# 📗 Part 02: Control Flow

## 🎯 Objectives
* Learn to control the execution path of the code.
* Master logical decision-making and repetition.
* **Status:** [Completed]

## 📚 Topics Covered
1.  **Conditional Statements:**
    * `if`, `else if`, `else`.
    * `switch` statements for cleaner menu logic.
    * Ternary Operator (`condition ? true : false`).
2.  **Loops (Iteration):**
    * `for`: When you know the number of iterations.
    * `while`: When you loop based on a condition.
    * `do-while`: When the code must run at least once (e.g., User Input).
3.  **Flow Control:**
    * `break`: Exit a loop instantly.
    * `continue`: Skip the current iteration.

## 🧪 Key Exercises
* [cite_start]**Pyramid Pattern:** Using nested loops to draw shapes[cite: 173].
* **Factorial Calculator:** Using a loop to calculate `n!`.
* [cite_start]**Prime Checker:** Determining if a number is prime using optimized loops[cite: 110].

## 🧠 Interview Note
> "Always check your loop termination condition to avoid Infinite Loops. In embedded systems, infinite loops are sometimes intentional (`while(1)`), but in logic, they are bugs."
